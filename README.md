Abstract

In this project multilayer perceptron(MLP) is proposed to optimize traffic signal system at an intersection. With a simulation model for vehicles passing through an intersection, we sought to find the signals that minimize the sum of square of the time spent by each vehicle. With this simulation model, a data set of the distribution of the vehicle labeled with optimal signal were created. With this labeled data we have made a MLP that derives the optimal signal when the distribution of the vehicle is given in advance.
